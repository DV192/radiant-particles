# 🪐 Radiant Particles - A Visual Particle Journey Through Space

[![Radiant Particles Preview](public/radiant-particles-screenshot.png)](https://radiant-particles.vercel.app/)

Radiant Particles is an immersive, sound-enhanced visual experience crafted with particle shaders, spatial lighting, and elegant UI transitions. Upon entry, users are welcomed by a glowing emblem surrounded by fading rings, leading into a cinematic particle animation that simulates drifting through a luminous galaxy. The environment blends shimmering golden-pink particles, spotlight-reactive glow effects, and subtle audio cues to create a calm yet mesmerizing atmosphere. It's not a portfolio - it's a moment of interaction, expression, and ambient artistry.

## ✨ Key Features:

- **🎧 Sound Toggle & Ambient Audio**: Full or muted experience choice, with looped background sound and sound-synced transitions.
- **🌠 Cosmic Particle Field**: Space-like particle animation with bloom lighting and responsive movement.
- **🔆 GLSL Spotlight Shader**: Subtle, top-left spotlight that causes particles to bloom and react.
- **🎯 Precision with Points & Shaders**: Particles rendered using ```THREE.Points``` and custom GLSL for maximum performance.
- **🎬 GSAP-Driven Timelines**: Sequenced entrance animations for logo, particles, UI, and text.
- **🔄 View Transitions**: Enhanced UI transitions using ```react-transition-group```.
